This is the development repo for the **Fontys Complex Software Systems Course** that starts Spring 2026.

We develop this course as a Markdown wiki and publish it to our Canvas LMS when we change it.

We also render a PDF course document from this same set of documents.

This wiki also includes some management pages to support the development of the course materials.

In principle any text- or Markdown-editor (or GitHub's own browser editor) can be used to edit, we prefer using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) as our authoring tool. Some of the text in this repo will use Obsidian specific markup.

Obsidian plugins used:

- List Callouts
- Excalidraw
