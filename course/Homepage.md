A complex software system is distinguished by its elaborate architecture. This typically involves a multitude of interacting components, often dispersed across various platforms and utilizing diverse technologies. Such systems are designed to manage large datasets, intricate logical processes, and necessitate a high degree of scalability, dependability, and ease of maintenance.

Several factors contribute to this system complexity. Components within the system are often highly interdependent, meaning they rely on each other. This interconnectedness can make implementing changes risky and troubleshooting problems challenging. The scale of the system is also a key factor, often operating with a large number of users, transactions, or data points. Furthermore, the integration of diverse technologies and platforms creates potential compatibility issues. Finally, complex systems must adapt to evolving requirements, constantly changing to meet new business needs.

It is important to differentiate between a complex software system and a full-stack development. While a full-stack developer possesses expertise across a range of technologies (front-end, back-end, database), a complex software system developer is focussed on qualities of the system and puts more effort into the overall architecture and functionality of a software system. A full-stack developer might contribute to a complex system, but the complexity itself is a characteristic of the system's design and operation, not the specific skillset of the individual developer.

In this software systems the _quality of the system_ takes the most attentions of the developers. Such software should be developed with security in mind and should be performant and maintainable. Many of the mentioned software qualities are leading to a design trade-off and require following of the industry best practices to resolve them.

In this semester we will learn how to design, implement and validate a high quality complex software systems according to the industry best practices. The measurable qualities of the system will be expressed in non-functional requirements as set by stakeholders.

In this semester, we will use a strategy of research based learning. Students will be challenged to solve a real world problem with real world stakeholders and have to perform research in order to tackle this problem. The complex context of the problem is essential to learn how to solve real world problems based on industry best practices.
