## Feedback

In [How to Feedpulse](https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/8356/pages/how-to-feedpulse "How to Feedpulse") we already discussed why it is valuable for your learning process to request feedback. In addition to this, in group projects it is also valuable to request feedback from your project group members. This is called 'peer feedback' or 'peer review'. In this course, you will use FeedPulse to organize this peer review.

As with individual feedback, we have created a set of guidelines to help you with the process of giving feedback to your peers and how to reflect on feedback that you received from your peers. 

### What do we expect from you?

Your teacher will explain how many times (and when) you need to request peer feedback from your group members. When giving feedback to peers, think about the following topics:

- What did the group member do well in the group project? What can the group member do better?
- What tasks did the group member perform for the group project? 
- How well does the group member perform its tasks? Does the result meet agreed quality expectations?
- Does the group member keep to agreements and other decisions made by the group?
- To what extent is the group member involved in the project? 
- How does the group member communicate (both verbally and written) to other peers? 

Tip: You can clarify your feedback by adding concrete examples.   
In this way it is easier for the group member to understand your point.

Pro-Tip: When you have multiple peer review moments, you can even evaluate to what extent the group member did something with previous given feedback and if the results meets your expectations.

Feedback is more valuable when the majority of the topics mentioned above are covered. Try to be extensive and as concrete as possible when giving feedback. Avoid one-liners (like: 'Good job!', or 'He is really funny!') as this doesn't help your group member in any way.

### What to do with received feedback?

When you have received feedback from your peers, take a moment to reflect on this. If the feedback shows that there is room for improvement, think about how you can do this.

- Why did the team member give you this feedback? 
- What can you do to improve yourself?
- When are you (and your group members) happy with the results? 

Tip: Discuss the resulting actionable items with your group members.   
In this way you show that you have taken the feedback seriously and reflected on it. 

### What can you expect from your teacher?

Your teacher adds a new FeedPulse peer review checkpoint which you can use to register feedback to your peers. You can discuss the quality of the feedback that you have given with your teacher. Furthermore, you can discuss any actionable items that you and your group members defined, based on the peer review results.

Tip: If you think that it will be valuable to have additional peer review moments, please don't hesitate to discuss this with your teacher.

Happy learning!

## FeedPulse

In this course, we use FeedPulse to provide you with insights into your learning process. For this to work, it is essential to regularly request your teachers' feedback on your work, planning, approach, and progress. Doing this gives clear guidance towards achieving the learning outcomes. Furthermore, it yields your teacher a means to help you improve your learning process.

To help you with gathering feedback and reflecting on this, we've created a set of comprehensible guidelines on how to work with FeedPulse.

### [](https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/8356/pages/how-to-feedpulse?module_item_id=592928#what-do-we-expect-from-you)What do we expect from you?

You frequently plan a feedback session with your teacher. There, you demonstrate your work, discuss your approach, and chosen solutions. With the help of your teacher, you need to find answers to the questions below:

- **What did I do?**  
    Did it go as planned? What didn't, and why not? Did I achieve what I envisioned, and why? Did I take on too much or too little? How did this affect me or my work? What's my teachers' point of view? Where do we differ?
- **What to work on next?**  
    What can I do next to achieve the learning outcomes in time? What's my approach? Does it need adjustment? What's my plan for these next actions? How do I eliminate possible impediments? How do I make sure that my ambitions are still workable? Where do I get missing information? What's my teachers' point of view? Where do we differ?
- **Where do I stand?**  
    Am I well on my way to achieve the learning outcomes? Can I independently guide and adjust my learning process? What's my teachers' point of view? Where do we differ?

Now, report the answers formulated based on your teachers' feedback as soon as possible at the latest checkpoint in FeedPulse. Next up, notify your teacher and ask to grant a smiley rating.

```
Tip: Even if your study stalls somehow, it's strongly advised to plan a feedback session.
Remember, your teacher is there to help you.
```

### [](https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/8356/pages/how-to-feedpulse?module_item_id=592928#what-can-you-expect-from-your-teacher)What can you expect from your teacher?

Your teacher adds a new FeedPulse checkpoint at the start of the feedback session. You both discuss the questions above, aimed at feedback on your work and learning process. After submitting the checkpoint and informing the teacher, you get a smiley rating. The teacher may provide additional comments if needed.

```
Tip: At times, your teacher may unintentionally forget to give a smiley rating. 
Please don't hesitate to ask again.
```

The smiley rating is an indication of whether your teacher expects you can achieve the learning outcomes, based on the process and work you demonstrated so far. While **no guarantee**, it can provide you with enough insight into your progress and presents a possibility to adjust your learning process as needed.

![[feedpulse-smileys.png]]
Here's how to interpret the smiley rating:

- **Big smile**: Wow. You demonstrate work beyond expectations. You manifest an independently guided and well-balanced learning process that makes achieving the learning outcomes very likely.
- **Neutral**: OK. You demonstrate work as expected. You manifest a learning process, making achieving the learning outcomes probable.
- **Sad**: Troubling. You didn't demonstrate any or limited work. You manifest a learning process that stands in the way of achieving the learning outcomes.

```
Tip: If everything goes well, you won't be surprised by the smiley rating your teacher has given
you. If it does, please ask your teacher. Note that it is essential to clarify the reason behind 
the grade for you to take charge of your learning process.
```

Happy learning!  
  

One more note on Feedback  
By receiving feedback regularly from your teachers or peers, you can determine if you're still doing well in achieving your semester goals. Feedback will help you to improve your understanding of the learning outcomes during the semester. Secondly, it gives you information where there is still room for improvement in your learning process and created products.
