During the semester, you will study together with other students and receive feedback on various educational activities, allowing you to adjust your personal development and professional products during the semester. The result of this is combined into a portfolio, which showcases what you have learned and how you were able to apply this knowledge into your projects. The portfolio puts the spotlight on the learning outcomes reached, and shows what next steps you have planned in order to reach the remaining learning outcomes.

In the beginning #foo/bar/baz, you most likely have not gathered much evidence of proficiency on the learning outcome yet, but during the course you keep obtaining more and more and can add them to your portfolio. So, your first version is perhaps rather small and merely shows what you have started on, whereas your final version mentions all pieces of work that you believe are proofs of proficiency. The final version also explains why you believe you have successfully passed this semester on Enterprise Sofware Engineering #foo/bar/x and why you are ready for the next step (either a minor or graduation).

In this page we provide you with some guidelines that you can you can #foo use to put together your portfolio. The portfolio consists of two types of deliverables: a project overview (reading guide) and a collection of professional products.

To streamline the process of building up a portfolio and receiving feedback on its contents, we're using the Portfolio Tool in Canvas.

## Projects overview (reading guide)

In the projects overview (reading guide) you describe which professional products you have made during the semester and to what extent the product contributes to a specific learning outcome. It is advised to include professional products that add value to your projects and you have received positive feedback from your teachers on. The latter is important for the professional product to contribute to the proficient level of a learning outcome.

When describing what professional products you included in your portfolio, you may mention briefly what you have done in order to deliver the result, what feedback that you got from teachers (and how you reflected on this) and motivate why you think that the product contributes to a specific learning outcome. However, purpose of the reading guide is not to extensively describe what you have done during the semester. 

With each portfolio delivery, you can add some overall reflection on your progress within the semester. What went well? What results are you proud of? What did you learn? What feedback did you receive and in what way did this effect your way of working? Note that this may not only be related to technical subjects, but also to professional skills like communication, working together in a group, planning or presenting. 

Besides looking back and reflecting on your progress, you can also look forward: what are you going to do in the upcoming sprints? What do you think that still needs to be done in order to reach the proficient level for the different learning outcomes?

**Project Overview**

In the project overview, there is space for the student to explain the project and indicate for each learning outcome how that learning outcome has been demonstrated.

In the Evidence section ‘Project Overview’, there is space to submit a Word-document containing the following content:

- Context Description: The student describes the situation before the project started and why an improvement can be made here. Who encountered what issues, and why can it be better? (1/2 p.)
- Process Description: The student describes the steps taken from the moment the assignment was received. An easy structure is to follow the phases indicated in ‘Deliverables’. (1&1/2 p.)
- Self evaluation: A general reflection on this process can be done per phase if that is more comfortable for the student. The evaluation can also be done per sprint or portfolio iteration. It should include self assessment per learning outcome. (1 p.)

This text also refers to the products belonging to the various phases. In principle, all submitted products should be referenced.

Please submit a Word-document. The reason it is a Word-document is that it resembles what you will submit during graduation. You can immediately look at the layout. It also provides the language teacher with a clear product to review. Make sure to ask for feedback on it.

In the Learning Outcomes, a free text describes what you have submitted to prove that learning outcome. This also references the products, which are made clickable so the assessor can easily find the products.

**Deliverables**

The ‘Deliverables’ are organized per development phase. The student may organize this differently if preferred. The advantage of this format is that it is easy to see which products belong where and in what order they should be reviewed. If a student creates a folder structure based on these phases during graduation, it will also be clear to the assessors. In ‘The Professional’, the professional standard and personal leadership deliverables are included. This is at the forefront because a general project organization can also be submitted here, which occurs before the project starts.

## Professional products

The portfolio should contain all professional products that you created in order to deliver successful projects. What products (and in what order) you include is up to you, but the product should clearly be of value to projects. The portfolio is not a complete information dump of everything remotely related to projects.

In order to keep the portfolio clear and easy to browse through, it is a good idea to setup a folder structure that either relates to the different steps of the software development process (analysis, design, realisation, etc.) or the different learning outcomes. Furthermore, when including code, please make sure to include code that is relevant and clearly contributes to the learning outcomes and make sure that the code is properly cleaned (e.g. no .git folders, build output or 800 MB of node_modules). 

## How to add the Advanced Software template to your portfolio?

To add the Advanced Software template to your portfolio, please use the following steps:

In Portflow, click 'Add new' and select the option 'Import template'

Enter the following Template ID, for Autumn 2024 use: **S0UJMXD**

Click on the 'Import' button

## How to deliver the portfolio in Canvas?

To deliver the portfolio at a Canvas assignment, please use the following steps:

Create a snapshot of your portfolio. Use the 'Create a snapshot' button in the Portfolio tool to initiate this process and follow the steps

Go to the Canvas assignment, scroll down the page, click the 'More' button and then select the submission type 'Portfolio'

Select the portfolio snapshot that you just created and click 'Submit

## Portfolio (Portflow) tips

You can use the @ mark in the description fields to refer directly to added evidence. This inserts a direct link to your evidence from the description.

Evidence can be linked to multiple learning outcomes!

In the tab 'My Evidence' you get an overview of all your evidence and to which learning outcomes they are coupled. On this same page you can easily manage the relation between evidence and learning outcomes.

Use your evidence description to explain shortly why and how your evidence is relevant to the specific learning outcome(s).

Evidence can change during the semester. Don't be afraid to add evidence that feels not 'complete'.

Your evidence should have received feedback from a teacher or expert, before you can make claims about if it is sufficient or not to contribute to your learning otucomes.
