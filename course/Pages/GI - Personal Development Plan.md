[[LO2 - Software Quality]]

Every semester we expect you to make a development mplan for yourself. This plan helps you and your coaches through this semester. It also forms the basis under coaching meetings.

It is short, concise and flexible: it's a tool and not a fixed formal document. We expect you to adapt it regularly and at least every sprint. It is your personal "sprint" planning.

To help you formulate this plan we provide you with a few questions. By answering these you will get to your personal plan.
## Questions

### How are you going to do it?

### What expertise do you need?

## Update every sprint
