- As a software engineer, you have to operate in an environment which is uncertain on different aspects. Two of the most relevant aspects are
	- uncertainty on the needed requirements
	- uncertainty on how to use technology to implement the requirements
- Together they form a so-called Stacey Matrix

- The job of you as a software engineer, is to manage this complexity, so you will end up in the green parts of the picture above. This means using a way of working which helps you do that.
- If we look at software being used in companies, and both of the axis in the picture, we can identify 2 sorts of complexity
	- ### 1. Essential complexity:
	  The inherent difficulty in solving a problem due to its nature. For 
	  example, developing a real-time financial trading platform that ensures 
	  data consistency, low latency, and strict compliance with regulations 
	  also contains high essential complexity.
	  
	  This system is complex because the problem domain is complex. No 
	  matter how well you design your software, the complexity remains.
	  
	  This complexity is related to the WHAT/'requirements' axis.
	-
	- ### 2. Accidental complexity:
	  
	  The complexity added due to the way a problem is solved. Poorly 
	  written code, overengineering, unnecessary abstraction, or inadequate 
	  tooling all contribute to accidental complexity. For example, creating a
	  custom solution for a problem that could have been solved using 
	  standard libraries leads to extra development time, hard-to-maintain 
	  code, and inconsistent behavior.
	  
	  This complexity is related to the HOW/'implementation' axis.
