You can base derive them from the group project, your individual interests as described in the [[GI - Personal Development Plan]].

## How to find topics?

- The [Thoughtworks Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/search) is a great resources. They track software engineering techniques, platforms, tools, languages and frameworks. They also assess how relevant or new they are. For each topic (more than 4000 topic in the database) they have a short description.
