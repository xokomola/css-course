You apply an engineering approach when creating software systems in unknown domains and with unknown systems and technologies. You execute progressive steps towards your goal by applying system thinking and informed decision making.  

## Further clarification 

### Engineering approach 

- You apply short feedback cycles.
- You justify your decisions by validating your choices and technical solutions by measurable outcomes. This could be done e.g. by evidence-based experiments with concepts relevant to your project, including the use of GenAI-assisted prototyping and validation, and decide, based on outcomes, whether an experiment might add value to the project. 
    

### System thinking 

- You analyze interdependencies between components, processes, data and stakeholders, focusing on architectural decisions.   
    

### Informed decision making  

- You justify your design choices based on the business context, system landscape, and project requirements, ensuring your environment is fit-for-purpose.
