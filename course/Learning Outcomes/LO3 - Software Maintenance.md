## Further clarification 

### Maintainable

- You deploy your software in a running environment and continuously monitor the desired behavior of the system and its integrations.
- You apply a process which manages system changes. 

### Development process improvement 

- You verify the non-functional requirements of your infrastructure.  
- You integrate practices (e.g., DORA metrics) that improve efficiency and reliability of software delivery and the development process within a team.  
- You advise on potential improvements of the stakeholder’s infrastructure.  
- You justify the feasibility to deploy your system at the stakeholder’s organization.
