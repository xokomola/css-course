You adapt software systems with sustainable software quality by systematically addressing both functional and non-functional requirements within the current project while continuously validating system behavior against well-defined quality aspects.  

## Further clarification 

### Sustainable software quality  

- You apply practices that support long-term sustainability of software, while adapting to the newest industry practices (eg. In fields of AI specific requirements, UX).   

### Continuous validation  

- You apply best practices to measure system qualities over time in a setup that is effective in reproducibility, diagnostics, and supports quality improvement cycles.  

### Well-defined quality  

- You use quality frameworks (e.g. ISO/IEC 25010 inspired) to identify and translate quality attributes such as scalability, maintainability, performance and security into software products of measurable quality.
